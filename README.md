# Form focus for Rails

Focus the first field in a form in a Rails application.

## Usage

```javascript
//= require form-focus-rails
```

If you want the autofocus to work on a specific part of your page (say you want to exclude any inputs you have in your navigation bar), wrap this part of the page in a <tt>form-focus</tt> CSS class.
